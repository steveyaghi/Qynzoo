## Executive Summary

**Severity Summary**:
- üî¥ CRITICAL: 0
- üü† HIGH: 0
- üü° MEDIUM: 0
- üü¢ LOW: 0
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è INFO: N/A (Not Applicable)

**Overall Status**: ‚úÖ **NOT APPLICABLE - Static Website**

---

## Project Classification

**Type**: Static Marketing Website
**Authentication System**: None
**User Accounts**: None
**Backend**: None

---

## Analysis Results

This security domain is **NOT APPLICABLE** for the following reasons:

### 1. No Authentication System
- ‚úÖ Website does not have user registration/login
- ‚úÖ No password storage or hashing required
- ‚úÖ No JWT or session management needed
- ‚úÖ No account lockout mechanism required

### 2. No Authorization System
- ‚úÖ No protected resources requiring ownership checks
- ‚úÖ No role-based access control (RBAC) needed
- ‚úÖ No API endpoint authorization required
- ‚úÖ No privilege escalation risks

### 3. No Cookie-Based Sessions
- ‚úÖ No session cookies used
- ‚úÖ No token storage (localStorage or httpOnly cookies)
- ‚úÖ No session management required

---

## Contact Forms - Limited Security Context

While the website has contact forms, they do not constitute an authentication/authorization system:

- **Contact forms** submit data to Web3Forms (third-party service)
- **No user accounts** are created or managed
- **No persistent sessions** or authentication tokens
- **No protected resources** requiring access control

---

## Security Recommendations (General)

Although authentication is not applicable, consider these future-proofing recommendations:

### If Adding User Accounts in Future:

1. **Password Security**:
   - Use bcrypt with cost factor 12+
   - Implement password strength requirements
   - Add account lockout after 5 failed attempts

2. **Session Management**:
   - Use httpOnly cookies for session tokens
   - Implement JWT with short expiration (15 min access, 7 day refresh)
   - Never store tokens in localStorage

3. **Authorization**:
   - Implement RBAC from the start
   - Check resource ownership on every request
   - Prevent IDOR vulnerabilities

## GDPR Compliance Notes

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ **Compliant**

Since there are no user accounts:
- ‚úÖ No password storage concerns
- ‚úÖ No session data to protect
- ‚úÖ No authentication logs to maintain
- ‚úÖ No account deletion mechanism needed

**Note**: If user accounts are added in future, implement:
- Right to access (data export)
- Right to deletion (account deletion)
- Access logging for personal data

---

## Files Analyzed

Confirmed no authentication/authorization code in:
- ‚úÖ `index.html` - No login/registration forms
- ‚úÖ `js/script.js` - No auth-related JavaScript
- ‚úÖ `js/script.min.js` - No auth logic
- ‚úÖ No backend files detected (static site)

---

## Testing Requirements

**N/A** - No authentication system to test

---

## Conclusion

This security domain requires **NO ACTION** for the current static website implementation.

The absence of authentication and authorization systems actually **improves security** by:
- Eliminating password breach risks
- Removing session hijacking vulnerabilities
- Preventing unauthorized access issues
- Reducing attack surface significantly
