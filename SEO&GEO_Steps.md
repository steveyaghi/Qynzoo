   - Enter: `https://qynzoo.com`
   - Click "Continue"

4. **Verify Ownership** (Choose Method A or B):

     ```html
     <meta name="google-site-verification" content="abc123xyz..." />
     ```
   - Copy this entire tag
   - Add it to `index.html` in the `<head>` section (after line 15)
   - Save and redeploy
   - Go back to Search Console and click "Verify"

   **Method B: HTML File**
   - Download the file Google provides (e.g., `google1234567890.html`)
   - Upload it to your website root directory
   - Visit `https://qynzoo.com/google1234567890.html` to confirm it works
   - Go back to Search Console and click "Verify"

5. **Submit Sitemap:**
   - Once verified, go to "Sitemaps" in left menu
   - Enter: `sitemap.xml`
   - Click "Submit"

**Expected Result:** Google will start crawling within 24-48 hours!

---

### 2. Submit to Bing Webmaster Tools (10 minutes)

1. **Go to:** https://www.bing.com/webmasters
2. **Sign in** with Microsoft account
3. **Import from Google** (easiest way):
   - Click "Import from Google Search Console"
   - This automatically verifies and imports your sitemap!
4. **OR manually add:**
   - Enter: `https://qynzoo.com`
   - Verify using similar methods as Google
