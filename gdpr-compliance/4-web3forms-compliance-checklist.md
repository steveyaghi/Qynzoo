## Step 3: Request Data Processing Agreement (DPA)

### What is a DPA?
A Data Processing Agreement is a **legal contract** required by GDPR Article 28 between:
- **Data Controller** (Qynzoo - that's us)
- **Data Processor** (Web3Forms)

It defines:
- What data is processed
- How data is processed
- Security measures
- Data retention and deletion
- Breach notification procedures
- Sub-processor usage

### Is a DPA Required?
‚úÖ **YES** - Web3Forms is a data processor under GDPR because they process personal data on our behalf.

### How to Request a DPA:

#### Email Template to Send:

```
To: support@web3forms.com (or legal/privacy contact)
Subject: Data Processing Agreement (DPA) Request - GDPR Compliance

Dear Web3Forms Team,

We are a client of Web3Forms (Account: [Your account email]) and are conducting a GDPR compliance review.

As Web3Forms processes personal data on our behalf through contact form submissions, we require a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) as mandated by GDPR Article 28.

Could you please provide:

1. Your standard Data Processing Agreement (DPA)
2. Confirmation of the following:
   - Data storage location (USA/EU)
   - Use of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for EU-US transfers
   - Data retention period for form submissions
   - Data deletion procedures and timelines
   - Sub-processors used (if any)
   - Security measures and certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)

We need this documentation to update our Privacy Policy and ensure full GDPR compliance.

Please provide this information by [Date + 7 days].

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Qynzoo
Email: mostyaghi@outlook.com / bader.atem@qynzoo.com
Website: https://qynzoo.com
```

### Action Required:
- [ ] Send DPA request email to Web3Forms support
- [ ] Set calendar reminder to follow up in 7 days
- [ ] Save response when received
- [ ] Review DPA thoroughly (see Step 4)

---

## Step 4: Verify Data Location and Transfers

### Why This Matters:
- Web3Forms is a US-based company
- Transferring EU personal data to the USA requires **specific safeguards** under GDPR
- Without proper safeguards, transfers are **illegal** under GDPR

### Required Safeguards for EU-US Data Transfers:

Check which safeguards Web3Forms uses:

| Safeguard | Available? | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | EU Commission-approved contract terms |
| **Adequacy Decision** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | EU Commission approval of data protection level |
| **Privacy Shield** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | ‚ö†Ô∏è Invalidated in 2020 - NOT sufficient alone |
| **Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | Internal company rules for multinationals |
| **EU Data Hosting Option** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | Data stored in EU (best option) |

### Questions to Ask Web3Forms:

1. **Where exactly is data stored?**
   - Specific cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure?)
   - Specific regions (us-east-1, eu-west-1?)
   - Can we choose EU-only storage?

2. **What transfer mechanisms are in place?**
   - SCCs signed and available?
   - Supplementary measures beyond SCCs?

3. **Do they have an EU subsidiary or representative?**
   - GDPR Article 27 representative?
   - EU contact for data subjects?

### Action Required:
- [ ] Ask Web3Forms about data location
- [ ] Request confirmation of transfer safeguards
- [ ] Obtain copy of SCCs if used
- [ ] Document findings in table above

---

## Step 5: Check Data Retention Policies

### Why This Matters:
- GDPR requires data minimization - don't keep data longer than necessary
- We need to know how long Web3Forms retains form submissions
- Users have the right to erasure - we need to ensure Web3Forms can delete data

### Questions to Ask Web3Forms:

| Question | Answer | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **How long are form submissions stored?** | | Specific number of days/months |
| **Are submissions stored after email delivery?** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | Ideally No |
| **Are there logs separate from submissions?** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | Check log retention |
| **How long are logs retained?** | | Specific period |
| **Is there automatic deletion after X days?** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | Best practice |
| **Can retention period be customized?** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | Flexibility option |
| **What is deleted vs. anonymized?** | | True deletion vs. de-identification |

### Ideal Retention Policy:
- **Form submissions**: Deleted immediately after email delivery (or 24-48 hours max)
- **Logs**: Minimal, 30-90 days maximum
- **Backups**: Included in deletion process, purged within 90 days

### Action Required:
- [ ] Contact Web3Forms to confirm retention policies
- [ ] Document specific retention periods
- [ ] Request configuration of shortest possible retention
- [ ] Verify our Privacy Policy matches their retention periods

---

## Step 6: Verify Data Deletion Capabilities

### Why This Matters:
- Users have the **Right to Erasure** (GDPR Article 17)
- When we receive a deletion request, we must ensure Web3Forms deletes data too
- We need a clear process for requesting deletions from Web3Forms

### Questions to Ask Web3Forms:

| Question | Answer | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Is there a data deletion API or process?** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | How we request deletions |
| **How long does deletion take?** | | Immediate? 30 days? |
| **Are backups included in deletion?** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | True deletion required |
| **Is deletion confirmation provided?** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | Proof of deletion |
| **Can we delete by email address?** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | Lookup method |
| **Can we delete by date range?** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | Bulk deletion option |
| **Is deletion logged/auditable?** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | Compliance trail |

### Test the Deletion Process:

1. **Submit a test form** with test data:
   - Name: "GDPR Test User"
   - Email: "test-[date]@qynzoo.com"
   - Message: "This is a GDPR deletion test"

2. **Request deletion from Web3Forms**:
   - Use their deletion process
   - Time how long it takes
   - Request confirmation

3. **Verify deletion**:
   - Check if data is actually gone
   - Confirm backups are purged

### Action Required:
- [ ] Ask Web3Forms about deletion process
- [ ] Request deletion API documentation
- [ ] Perform test deletion (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Document the process for team reference

---

## Step 7: Configure Dashboard Security Settings

### Actions:

1. **Log into Web3Forms Dashboard**:
   - Account: [Your Web3Forms account email]
   - URL: https://web3forms.com/dashboard (or login page)

2. **Review Account Settings**:

| Setting | Current Value | Recommended Value | Action Required |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** | ‚òê Enabled ‚òê Disabled | ‚úÖ Enabled | [ ] Enable 2FA |
| **Access Key Visibility** | ‚òê Public ‚òê Private | ‚úÖ Private/Server-side | [ ] Make private |
| **Email Notifications** | ‚òê On ‚òê Off | ‚úÖ On (for security alerts) | [ ] Enable |
| **API Access Logs** | ‚òê Available ‚òê Not Available | ‚úÖ Review regularly | [ ] Check logs |

### Action Required:
- [ ] Log into Web3Forms dashboard
- [ ] Enable 2FA immediately
- [ ] Complete settings table above
- [ ] Make all recommended changes
- [ ] Document current configuration

---

## Step 8: Enable Spam Protection

### Why This Matters:
- Reduces spam submissions (saves inbox space and costs)
- Prevents bot abuse
- Improves data quality
- Reduces data we need to process/store

### Web3Forms Spam Protection Options:

Check which options are available and enable them:

| Protection Method | Available? | Enabled? | Notes |
|-------------------|------------|----------|-------|
| **Honeypot Field** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | Already in our HTML ‚úÖ |
| **reCAPTCHA v2/v3** | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No | Requires Google API key |

- Additional spam filters

### Configuration Steps:

1. **Enable Domain Whitelist**:
   - Only accept submissions from: `qynzoo.com`
   - Reject submissions from other domains
   - Test after enabling
