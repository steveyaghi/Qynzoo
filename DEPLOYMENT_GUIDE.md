# Qynzoo Website Deployment Guide

## ✅ GitHub Repository Setup - COMPLETED

Your website has been successfully pushed to:
**https://github.com/steveyaghi/Qynzoo**

## 🚀 Hostinger Deployment Options

You have **3 main options** for deploying this website to your Hostinger domain:

---

## **Option 1: Replace WordPress with Static Site (Recommended for Performance)**

### Pros:
- ✅ Blazing fast performance
- ✅ Better SEO
- ✅ Lower server resource usage
- ✅ No WordPress maintenance/updates needed
- ✅ Direct GitHub integration possible

### Cons:
- ❌ No WordPress/Elementor editing
- ❌ Need to edit HTML/CSS directly or use VS Code

### Steps:

1. **Backup Your Current WordPress Site**
   - Login to Hostinger hPanel
   - Go to "Websites" → Select qynzoo.com
   - Click "Backups" and create a full backup

2. **Access File Manager**
   - In hPanel, click "File Manager"
   - Navigate to `public_html` directory

3. **Clear Current WordPress Files**
   - Select all files in `public_html`
   - Delete them (your backup is safe)

4. **Upload New Website Files**

   **Method A: Using File Manager (Simple)**
   - Download your GitHub repository as ZIP
   - Upload ZIP to `public_html`
   - Extract the ZIP file
   - Move all files from the extracted folder to `public_html` root

   **Method B: Using Git (Recommended)**
   - In hPanel, go to "Advanced" → "SSH Access"
   - Enable SSH access
   - Connect via SSH:
     ```bash
     ssh your-username@your-server-ip
     cd public_html
     git clone https://github.com/steveyaghi/Qynzoo.git .
     ```

5. **Configure Domain**
   - Your domain should automatically point to `public_html`
   - Visit qynzoo.com to see your new site!

6. **Set Up Auto-Deployment (Optional)**
   - Use GitHub Actions or Hostinger's Git integration
   - Every push to GitHub automatically updates your site

---

## **Option 2: Run Static Site on Subdomain + Keep WordPress on Main Domain**

### Pros:
- ✅ Keep both websites running
- ✅ Gradual migration possible
- ✅ Keep WordPress for blog/backend

### Cons:
- ❌ Need to manage two sites
- ❌ Split traffic between domains

### Steps:

1. **Create Subdomain in Hostinger**
   - Go to hPanel → "Domains" → "Subdomains"
   - Create: `new.qynzoo.com` or `app.qynzoo.com`

2. **Upload Static Site to Subdomain**
   - Follow Option 1 steps but use subdomain directory instead
   - Usually located at: `public_html/subdomain_name/`

3. **Test at**: `new.qynzoo.com`

4. **When Ready to Switch**
   - Change domain DNS to point to new subdomain
   - Or move files from subdomain to main domain

---

## **Option 3: Hybrid - WordPress + Static Site Pages**

### Pros:
- ✅ Keep WordPress for some pages
- ✅ Use static site for performance-critical pages
- ✅ Can still use Elementor for blog

### Cons:
- ❌ More complex setup
- ❌ Potential style conflicts
- ❌ Not ideal long-term

### Steps:

1. **Keep WordPress in Root**
   - Your WordPress stays in `public_html`

2. **Create Subdirectory for Static Site**
   ```
   public_html/
   ├── wp-admin/          (WordPress)
   ├── wp-content/        (WordPress)
   ├── static/            (Your new site)
   │   ├── index.html
   │   ├── css/
   │   ├── js/
   │   └── ...
   ```

3. **Upload Static Files**
   - Create folder: `public_html/static/`
   - Upload all your website files there

4. **Access at**: `qynzoo.com/static/`

5. **Redirect Homepage to Static (Optional)**
   - Create `.htaccess` in `public_html`:
     ```apache
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteRule ^$ /static/index.html [L]
     ```

## 🎨 About WordPress + Elementor Editing

### ⚠️ **Important Reality Check**

Your current website is built with:
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (Static files)
- **Not compatible** with WordPress/Elementor

WordPress/Elementor cannot directly edit static HTML websites because:
1. WordPress uses PHP and a database
2. Elementor needs WordPress to function
3. Your site is static HTML files

### **Solutions for Easy Editing:**

#### Solution A: Use VS Code + GitHub (Recommended)
1. Install VS Code
2. Clone your GitHub repo
3. Edit files locally
4. Push to GitHub
5. Auto-deploy to Hostinger

#### Solution B: Use Hostinger's Code Editor
1. Edit files directly in File Manager
2. Built-in code editor available
3. Changes are immediate

#### Solution C: Convert to WordPress Theme (Complex)
1. Hire developer to convert HTML to WordPress theme
2. Then you can use Elementor
3. **Estimated cost**: $500-$2000
4. **Time**: 1-2 weeks
5. **Worth it?** Only if you need WordPress features

#### Solution D: Use Website Builder Alternative
- **Framer**: Import HTML/CSS, visual editing
- **Webflow**: Convert to Webflow project
- **Netlify CMS**: Add CMS to static site

5. ✅ GitHub version control
6. ✅ Easy to maintain with VS Code
